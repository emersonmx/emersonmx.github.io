had made in <a href=https://www.python.org/>Python</a> to Android. It wasn't difficult to find articles on the
subject, but one common theme was that to run Python on Android, you needed
<a href=https://github.com/kivy/buildozer>Buildozer</a>. And so, my saga began.</p><p>I spent two days wrestling with Buildozer to generate an APK. On the first day,
I decided to create a simple example to test the build. After encountering
several errors, I realized it would be easier to run Buildozer in <a href=https://www.docker.com/>Docker</a>.
Luckily, there was already a Dockerfile in the Buildozer project for this
purpose. With a few adaptations, I had it up and running on my machine.</p><p>The next step was configuring Buildozer for the build, which led me to dive
deep into <a href=https://www.docker.com/>Python for Android</a> (p4a). After spending a lot of time running
builds, reading documentation, and analyzing error logs, I concluded that it
would be better to create a p4a recipe for <a href=https://github.com/kivy/python-for-android>pygame-ce</a> and see how it
worked.</p><p>In the end, the pygame-ce recipe worked, and the errors stopped. The next step
was to see if the generated APK would run on Android. So, I opened the Android
emulator, installed the APK, and... nothing. The game opened and then
immediately closed. Checking the <a href=https://developer.android.com/tools/logcat>Logcat</a>, I realized I needed to tweak the
Buildozer configuration to generate an APK for x86_64 and also set the correct
SDK version. After doing that, I reinstalled the APK, and the game finally
opened! ü§≤</p><p>After all this struggle, I decided to <a href=https://gist.github.com/emersonmx/c5bba202506e3c3d2d828ad278a8d5fe>share the knowledge</a> I gained with
the Pygame community. However, I also concluded that it might not be worth
porting my Python game to Android üôÅ.</p></article></main><footer class="m-3 text-center"><div>&copy;
