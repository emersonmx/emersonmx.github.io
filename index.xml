&lt;code>new-session&lt;/code>, &lt;code>new-window&lt;/code>, &lt;code>split-window&lt;/code>, and &lt;code>send-keys&lt;/code> commands. While
powerful, this manual setup can become cumbersome, especially for complex
project layouts or when you need to quickly spin up a consistent development
environment across different machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is where &lt;code>tp&lt;/code> comes in. Inspired by the desire for a simpler, more
declarative way to handle &lt;code>tmux&lt;/code> sessions, &lt;code>tp&lt;/code> is a command-line tool written
in Rust designed to streamline this process. It allows you to define your
entire &lt;code>tmux&lt;/code> session, including multiple windows and panes with specific
directories and commands, in simple YAML configuration files, and then load
them with a single command.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Difficulties in Building a Pygame Game for Android</title><link>https://blog.emersonmx.dev/posts/difficulties-in-building-a-pygame-game-for-android/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 17:03:25 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.emersonmx.dev/posts/difficulties-in-building-a-pygame-game-for-android/</guid><description>&lt;p>Recently, I was taking an &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/courses">Android&lt;/a> course and got the urge to port a game I
had made in &lt;a href="https://www.python.org/">Python&lt;/a> to Android. It wasn't difficult to find articles on the
subject, but one common theme was that to run Python on Android, you needed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kivy/buildozer">Buildozer&lt;/a>. And so, my saga began.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent two days wrestling with Buildozer to generate an APK. On the first day,
I decided to create a simple example to test the build. After encountering
several errors, I realized it would be easier to run Buildozer in &lt;a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker&lt;/a>.
Luckily, there was already a Dockerfile in the Buildozer project for this
purpose. With a few adaptations, I had it up and running on my machine.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Skelly: A Scaffold Tool</title><link>https://blog.emersonmx.dev/posts/skelly-a-scaffold-tool/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Aug 2024 16:30:11 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.emersonmx.dev/posts/skelly-a-scaffold-tool/</guid><description>&lt;p>I've been facing issues with scaffold tools for a long time, whether because
they’re slow or missing essential features. But one day, I got tired of these
limitations and decided to create my own tool 😁.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I chose a trendy language (&lt;a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust&lt;/a>) and started looking for libraries that could
help me implement what I had in mind. I wanted something easy to install, with
a template engine similar to &lt;a href="https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.10.x/">Jinja2&lt;/a>, that could work with pipes and offer
only the essentials.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tic Tac Toe</title><link>https://blog.emersonmx.dev/policies/tictactoe/</link><pubDate>Wed, 14 Aug 2024 12:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.emersonmx.dev/policies/tictactoe/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="privacy-policy">Privacy Policy&lt;/h2>

throwaway projects. I even created a &lt;a href="https://github.com/emersonmx/dotfiles/blob/main/dot_local/bin/executable_cocu">script&lt;/a> (&lt;code>cocu&lt;/code>) to simplify the
process, but I rarely remember to use it. During this period, I struggled a
lot with the &lt;code>cookiecutter&lt;/code>, but in the end, I came to the conclusion that it
is simpler to document the process of creating a new project than to blindly
depend on it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The process I'm following is quite simple; just follow these steps:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My First Post</title><link>https://blog.emersonmx.dev/posts/my-first-post/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Apr 2020 17:12:58 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://blog.emersonmx.dev/posts/my-first-post/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hello world! :D&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
